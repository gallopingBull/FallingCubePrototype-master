keep delay, but also check y position of cube before grabbing. the y position of the cube and player should be the same (im assuming some whole value).
the point is to check neither player or target cube is falling.


in additin to what was said above. i think there needs to be further decoupling of physics responsibilites for the player and/or cube. meaning that gameobject and behaviors that rely on the layer name for either of 
those gameobjects should be moved to their own game object. conditions that rely on the top of gameobject should have their own physics layer. 

------
- after a cube is moved or falls
	- the target cube should call the cube manager to check if the cube has fallen at a transform.postition with whole numbers 
		- if not make them whole numbers

	- the cube manager should also double check adjacent cubes to verify their positions are wholen numbers	
		- if not make them whole numbers
	
	- then check same adjacent cubes for near by colors 
		- if similar, add those cuves to list to explode cube 

- test pause menu and take another look at the canvas gameobject and how its setup across scenes
	- any room for improvement or consildation, etc.

plan and break down how to manage dynamic data(unity projects, code, games, etc), static data (images, videos, etc), and os/programs/etc. across built in ssd storage and secondary storage devices (external/internall ssds) for current pc and laptop as I was thinking about today on 7/2.
