prevent player from grabbing cube while they or the a cube is falling.
	- keep grab delay, but also check y position of cube before grabbing. the y position of the cube and player should be the same (im assuming some whole value).
	- in additin to what was said above. i think there needs to be further decoupling of physics responsibilites for the player and/or c. meaning that gameobject and behaviors that rely on the layer name for either of 
	those gameobjects should be moved to their own game object. conditions that rely on the top of gameobject should have their own physics layer. 

------

- test pause menu and take another look at the canvas gameobject and how its setup across scenes
	- any room for improvement or consildation, etc.
	
----------

save instances of randomly generated maps from within the player and editor.

generate random map in editor

KEYBOAARD NAVIGATION/INPUT (WASD AND DIR. KEYS) NOT DETECTED IN MAIN MENU OR PAUSE MENU

KEYBOAARD/GAMEPAD/DECK NAVIGATION/INPUT (WASD AND DIR. KEYS) NOT DETECTED IN MAIN MENU IN INFINITE MODE

ENTER KEY OVER 'RETURN TO GAME' BUTTON DOES NOTHING IN PAUSE MENU
	- A BUTTON DOES ON GAMEPAD AND DECK
	
MOUSE CURSOR OR SELECTION GOES MISSING IF EMPTY SPACE IS SELECTED WITH MOUSE.
	- SOLUTION? 
		- if (EventSystem.current.currentSelectedGameObject == null)
		EventSystem.current.SetSelectedGameObject(myFirstSelectedGameObject);

LINUX (SteamDeck) issues:

	infinite mode: 	
		- dpad not working
		
	test stacked cubes scene:
			only way to exit out of scene is by dying. back button doesnt do anything and no menu is displayed with start button.

cool idea: show arm coming down when left or right trigger are released during climbing. maybe the player appears like theyre falling?w
idea: slow mo power up like bullet time, or activated when narrowly dodgin cube.
idea: cubes that are snapped together from whatever side they interact with each other with. 
idea: implement double cherry power up similar to mario bros
ideas about infinite mode:
- map randomly generates periodically through the round
	- the frequency of this should be dertermined by difficulty/round length/total score/ etc/
- The player should be able to trigger these map  regeneration a limited set of times. 
	- maybe this earned through a session, or only a finite count is allowed?
	- this should help in difficult situations or if the current arena is not providing any 
	valuable oppurtunites.
	
- the player can hack any cube and change its properties(color, maybe type?).

- time is constantly decrementing. matching cubes earn points and more time. 


----

spawnData is used during cube manager initilzation, spawning cubes, monitroing/debug.


this sounds like this may be two seperare lists. one that is for spawning which is used at the begingin and maybe level creation as well.

And another cube data and cube data list that is used to track cubes through out a match/context.


---------

plan and break down how to manage dynamic data(unity projects, code, games, etc), static data (images, videos, etc), and os/programs/etc. across built in ssd storage and secondary storage devices (external/internall ssds) for current pc and laptop as I was thinking about today on 7/2.
