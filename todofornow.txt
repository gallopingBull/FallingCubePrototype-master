prevent player from grabbing cube while they or the a cube is falling.
	- keep grab delay, but also check y position of cube before grabbing. the y position of the cube and player should be the same (im assuming some whole value).
	- in additin to what was said above. i think there needs to be further decoupling of physics responsibilites for the player and/or c. meaning that gameobject and behaviors that rely on the layer name for either of 
those gameobjects should be moved to their own game object. conditions that rely on the top of gameobject should have their own physics layer. 

------
- the cube code has been refactored and works as it was before -- which is about 90% from good enough. When a cube is move to an adjacent cube in a corner location, or the cube is moved to any empty location and falls over a matching cube underneath, the cube will successfully destory and player gains a score.

However, when the player is pushing a cube adjacent a single unit next to a matching cube, there's still room to expand the window of forgivness to allow for gurantted a combo and score.

- test pause menu and take another look at the canvas gameobject and how its setup across scenes
	- any room for improvement or consildation, etc.

plan and break down how to manage dynamic data(unity projects, code, games, etc), static data (images, videos, etc), and os/programs/etc. across built in ssd storage and secondary storage devices (external/internall ssds) for current pc and laptop as I was thinking about today on 7/2.
