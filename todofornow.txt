prevent player from grabbing cube while they or the a cube is falling.
	- keep grab delay, but also check y position of cube before grabbing. the y position of the cube and player should be the same (im assuming some whole value).
	- in additin to what was said above. i think there needs to be further decoupling of physics responsibilites for the player and/or c. meaning that gameobject and behaviors that rely on the layer name for either of 
those gameobjects should be moved to their own game object. conditions that rely on the top of gameobject should have their own physics layer.

- test pause menu and take another look at the canvas gameobject and how its setup across scenes
	- any room for improvement or consildation, etc.
	
----------

save instances of randomly generated maps from within the player and editor.

generate random map in editor

---------

plan and break down how to manage dynamic data(unity projects, code, games, etc), static data (images, videos, etc), and os/programs/etc. across built in ssd storage and secondary storage devices (external/internall ssds) for current pc and laptop as I was thinking about today on 7/2.

I have mouse0 assigned for mouse/key input in my derived vPushAndPullController class. This worked fine up until recently where mouse0 and left shift started log warning unity messages and I wasn't able to use the mouse button 0 to push or pull objects anymore.  

I finally got a chance to investigate the issue and it seems invector input device detection is not successfully detecting when i move between mouse/keyboard and a gamepad. When I check what's being returned with startPushPullInput.GetButton() and it's returning the gamepad unity input ("RB") and not the expected input and device (Mouse 0).

The other thing of note is that the warning messages imply that  mouse0 and left shift were in the input manager, but they were keycode values. So i thought it was interesting that a warning message for those keys was being logged.


This is the commit that caused the issue:

--------------------

LEFT STICK ON GAMEPAD IS NOT BEING DETECTED DURING PAUSE MENU NAVIGATION.
	- ONLY ESC KEY AND START BUTTON SEEM TO CORRECTLY TOGGLE PAUSE MENU.
	
ENTER KEY OVER 'RETURN TO GAME' BUTTON DOES NOTHING IN PAUSE MENU
	- A BUTTON DOES ON GAMEPAD
	
THE MAIN MENU SEEMS TO HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES, BUT IN REVERSE OR OPPOSITE OF THE INPUTS/DEVICE.
	
MOUSE CURSOR OR SELECTION GOES MISSING IF EMPTY SPACE IS SELECTED WITH MOUSE.
	- SOLUTION? 
		- if (EventSystem.current.currentSelectedGameObject == null)
		EventSystem.current.SetSelectedGameObject(myFirstSelectedGameObject);
