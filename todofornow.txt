prevent player from grabbing cube while they or the a cube is falling.
	- keep grab delay, but also check y position of cube before grabbing. the y position of the cube and player should be the same (im assuming some whole value).
	- in additin to what was said above. i think there needs to be further decoupling of physics responsibilites for the player and/or c. meaning that gameobject and behaviors that rely on the layer name for either of 
	those gameobjects should be moved to their own game object. conditions that rely on the top of gameobject should have their own physics layer. 

------

- test pause menu and take another look at the canvas gameobject and how its setup across scenes
	- any room for improvement or consildation, etc.
	
----------

save instances of randomly generated maps from within the player and editor.

generate random map in editor

--------------------


	
MOUSE CURSOR OR SELECTION GOES MISSING IF EMPTY SPACE IS SELECTED WITH MOUSE.
	- SOLUTION? 
	- fix mouse input in menus in general
		- if (EventSystem.current.currentSelectedGameObject == null)
		EventSystem.current.SetSelectedGameObject(myFirstSelectedGameObject);

LINUX (SteamDeck) issues:


	test stacked cubes scene:
			only way to exit out of scene is by dying. back button doesnt do anything and no menu is displayed with start button.

cool idea: show arm coming down when left or right trigger are released during climbing. maybe the player appears like theyre falling?w
idea: slow mo power up when player moves at  regular spped and everything else moves slower for a duration of time.
idea: cubes that are snapped together from whatever side they interact with each other with. 
idea: implement double cherry power up similar to mario bros
idea: eagle vision/detective vision-like feature that allows the playr to see colored cubes through other cubes. 

ideas about infinite mode:
- map randomly generates periodically through the round
	- the frequency of this should be dertermined by difficulty/round length/total score/ etc/
- The player should be able to trigger these map  regeneration a limited set of times. 
	- maybe this earned through a session, or only a finite count is allowed?
	- this should help in difficult situations or if the current arena is not providing any 
	valuable oppurtunites.
	
- the player can hack any cube and change its properties(color, maybe type?).

- time is constantly decrementing. matching cubes earn points and more time. 


----

spawnData is used during cube manager initilzation, spawning cubes, monitroing/debug.


this sounds like this may be two seperare lists. one that is for spawning which is used at the begingin and maybe level creation as well.

And another cube data and cube data list that is used to track cubes through out a match/context.


---------

plan and break down how to manage dynamic data(unity projects, code, games, etc), static data (images, videos, etc), and os/programs/etc. across built in ssd storage and secondary storage devices (external/internall ssds) for current pc and laptop as I was thinking about today on 7/2.  	


--cenagage

collecting the full benchmark session is expensive, and there isn't an immediate way to translate our data to unity profiler data [look into]. also, profiler recorder has a fix count cap that are build exeeds.

	- maybe create a local benchmark test that runs in the editor and saves the log file (but this will also be an issue to store these if too big.)

i think it owuld be best to show line graphs at run time instead

line graph for overall summary page to show averages for each metric for each buid over time
