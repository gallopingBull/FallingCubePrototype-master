prevent player from grabbing cube while they or the a cube is falling.
	- keep grab delay, but also check y position of cube before grabbing. the y position of the cube and player should be the same (im assuming some whole value).
	- in additin to what was said above. i think there needs to be further decoupling of physics responsibilites for the player and/or c. meaning that gameobject and behaviors that rely on the layer name for either of 
those gameobjects should be moved to their own game object. conditions that rely on the top of gameobject should have their own physics layer. 

------

- test pause menu and take another look at the canvas gameobject and how its setup across scenes
	- any room for improvement or consildation, etc.
	
----------

save instances of randomly generated maps from within the player and editor.

generate random map in editor

---------

plan and break down how to manage dynamic data(unity projects, code, games, etc), static data (images, videos, etc), and os/programs/etc. across built in ssd storage and secondary storage devices (external/internall ssds) for current pc and laptop as I was thinking about today on 7/2.  	


--------------------

LEFT STICK ON GAMEPAD IS NOT BEING DETECTED DURING PAUSE MENU NAVIGATION.
	- ONLY ESC KEY AND START BUTTON SEEM TO CORRECTLY TOGGLE PAUSE MENU.
	
ENTER KEY OVER 'RETURN TO GAME' BUTTON DOES NOTHING IN PAUSE MENU
	- A BUTTON DOES ON GAMEPAD
	
THE MAIN MENU SEEMS TO HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES, BUT IN REVERSE OR OPPOSITE OF THE INPUTS/DEVICE.
	
MOUSE CURSOR OR SELECTION GOES MISSING IF EMPTY SPACE IS SELECTED WITH MOUSE.
	- SOLUTION? 
		- if (EventSystem.current.currentSelectedGameObject == null)
		EventSystem.current.SetSelectedGameObject(myFirstSelectedGameObject);

LINUX (SteamDeck) issues:

	infinite mode: 	
		- player controller breaks. camera dont move but mesh is still moving around.

		- dpad not working
		
		- test stacked cubes scene -
			only way to exit out of scene is by dying. back button doesnt do anything and no menu is displayed with start button.
		
Linux Configurations:

	- Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Configuration > Scripting Backend > IL2CPP
	- Build Settings 
		> Target Platform > Linux
		> Architecture > x86_64
		
	- Input Manager(Legacy) > Add custom Trigger Input

----=----

cool idea: show arm coming down when left or right trigger are released during climbing. maybe the player appears like theyre falling?
